# Janatahack-Cross-Sell-Prediction
Cross-selling identifies products or services that satisfy additional, complementary needs that are unfulfilled by the original product that a customer possesses.

Oftentimes, cross-selling points users to products they would have purchased anyways; by showing them at the right time, a store ensures they make the sale.
